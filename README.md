## Setup & Installation

Vite requires Node.js version >= 12.0.0. If you have already installed Node.js according to the requirement, you can start scaffolding your Vite project.

```
npm init vite@latest

or

yarn create vite
```

After that, Vite will ask you some question below:

- Project name
- Select a framework: vanilla, vue, react, preact, etc.
- Select a variant: javascript, typescript

```
cd your-project
npm install
npm run dev
```
